This is the "core AST", the goal is for everything to be "lowerable" to this, with trap doors where necessary. Here "ast concepts" could be called "special forms" in most lisps.

The basic ideal of this is that programming is reducible to a couple core concepts:

1. Algebraics (assign a name to an operation)
2. Input/Output
3. Branching
4. Iteration
5. Concurrency

These basic ideas do not play well together. The simplest iteration concept (besides recursion) is the `while` construct. But the simplest algebraic assignment concept is the `let`, which, without variables, does not allow for the state modification necessary for a functioning `while` concept. This is the question of function vs. imperative design. And we chooseâ€¦ both, because we can. But we choose imperative first, since this is not a high level API that we will be optimizing, but a low level universal execution escape; and most hardware operates on an imperative paradigm.

So let's build our imperative ast concepts (described here in classic lisp syntax):

1. `(do exprs*)` evaluates exprs in order.
   - In a new scope, determined by the current scope.
     - TopLevel scopes create new "TopLevel subscopes"
     - FunctionStack scopes create new "Stack subscopes"
     - Scope allows for variable definition
     - Scope allows for destructors to be called
   - Last expression is returned, nil if empty
2. `(while condition exprs*)` this is our loop construct.
   - evaluates `exprs` as if in ` do` until condition is false.
   - loops can be labeled, via meta data
   - `(while/break &label)` will break a loop
   - `(while/continue &label)` will continue a loop
3. `(cond branches* &else)` this is our condition construct
   - `branches` are `(condition exprs*)`
   - special form accepts meta data accessors (ala `cond/likely-false`) for manipulating the cond
4. `(def name value &modifiers*)`
   - defines `name` in the current scope, assigns `value` to it.
   - `value` can be a dispatcher or lambda for functions.
     - `(defn name [args] exprs*)` is a helper form for this
     - modifiers can be accessed/added via the metadata access form `(defn/:const)` or so on
   - modifiers can come from a lot of places, some can be flat keywords the form understands
     - `:const` is like a let, the define cannot be set, only go out of scope, or be defined over in a new scope
     - storage type (atomic, variable, reference, special)
     - dynamic or not
     - default modifiers can be set on a Scope type (and scope types often create default modifiers that make sense at toplevel vs function vs class vs lambda)
5. `(set name value)` sets the named variable to `value`, assuming the storage type agrees.
6. `(mut name exprs*)` mutates the named variable, assuming the storage type agrees.
   - `(method name [args] {conditions} exprs*)` is a low level helper that executes this for dispatchers
     - signal dispatch is simply `(method)`s on dynamic variables



Now again, but with our functional ast concepts (described here in classic lisp syntax):

1. `(let [bindings*] exprs*)` evaluates bindings and binds them to the context, then executes expers as if an implicit do.
   - Creates a scope like `do` does.
     - This scope does not allow variable definition.
   - The `let` scope's variables are created with an implicit const by default.
2. `(loop [bindings*] exprs*)` operates much like a let, except enables `recur`.
   - `(loop/recur &label bindings*)` with matching arity
3. `(cond)` this is the same
4. `(def)` for top level forms only



Our list of AST types is then:

- `Scope`
  - various inherited versions of this with features set as necessary
- `While`
  - `Break` and `Continue` refbacks.
- `Loop`
  - `Recur` refbacks.
- `Cond`
- `Define`
  - with a dynamic scope lookup capability
- `Variable`
  - with a dynamic define lookup capability
- `Modify`
  - with a dynamic define lookup capability
  - `set` (variable is mutated) vs `mut` (object is mutated) vs ??
    - `get` (variable is safely retrieved; error if not used?)
    - `del` (variable is destructed and cleared now)
    - The semantics of these use `:keywords` as a dispatched argument on the special form
      - and `set` is then a macro for `(Modify :set <variable> rest*)`
